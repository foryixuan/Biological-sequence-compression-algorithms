# Biological-sequence-compression-algorithms
## SeqCompress
1. Preprocess.py and SeqCompress_main.py were scripts for the first algorithm.
2. Using preprocess.py to process the origin sequence.
3. Using SeqCompress_main.py to finish the compressing.We supply an function,users can change the sequence and length according to their own requirements .
## Segment_repetition_compress
This script was based on the SeqCompress.py.
## SeedBasedCompressing
1. In this script,we supply the functions of seed generating,sequence extending and sequence compressing.
2. Users can change the origin sequence,length of the seed based. on their own requirements.
